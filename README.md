## General Information
-The application is developed only using React.js and its React library features. 
- As per request, no React component libraries or UI frameworks were used in this assignment.
<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->


## Technologies Used
- React.js


## Features
The project 
List the ready features here:
- Expected Front-end Development
- Dark/Light Theme
- Load More Option


## Setup
No other external requirements / dependencies are required to setup or execute this system in one's local environment.


## Usage
This project uses Npm as package manager.
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.


## Project Status
Project is: _in progress_ 


## Room for Improvement
This project application consists of a few areas that need to be slightly improved, which could have been accomplished with much time.

Room for improvement:
- Effective navigation between cards using an ID
- Active slider bar with a visible track
- Implementation of relevant APIs
